About the project I did at Central University of Punjab on Acoustic Metamaterials.
</p>

<h2>What are Acoustic Metamaterials?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Materials designed to control the transmission of sound waves</li>
  <li>Composed of small, repeating structures that alter the path of sound waves</li>
  <li>Result in unusual acoustic properties</li>
</ul>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Design and fabricate acoustic metamaterials that can control the propagation of sound waves in specific frequency ranges</li>
  <li>Analyze the acoustic behavior of different materials and structures using computer simulations and experimental techniques</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Computer simulations using COMSOL Acoustics</li>
  <li>Additive manufacturing of sonic crystals using 3-D printing</li>
  <li>Hardware including SPL meter, Amplifiers, speakers and monitoring software.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collaborators</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Dr. Prashant S Alegaonkar, Associate Professor of Physics, Central University of Punjab</li>
  <li>Dr. Himangshu B Baskey, Scientist F, DRDO DMSRDE Kanpur</li>
  <li>Dr. Shyamal Chinke, Assistant Professor of Electronic Science, Savitribai Phule Pune University</li>
  <li>Sayantan Gantait, Graduate Student, Central University of Punjab</li>
</ul>

<h2>Major Results</h2>

<p>
Through our studies, we were able to create acoustic metamaterials that exhibited the desired acoustic properties. Specifically, we were able to control the propagation of sound waves in certain frequency ranges, and were able to develop sonic crystals capable of broadband sound suppression in the 1-8kHz range.
</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Our project was a fascinating exploration of the science of sound and the potential applications of acoustic metamaterials. By manipulating the properties of materials at a microscopic level, we can create structures that have unprecedented control over the transmission of sound waves. We believe that our findings have exciting implications for fields such as noise reduction and signal processing.
