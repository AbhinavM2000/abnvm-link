About the project I did at Central University of Punjab on Acoustic Metamaterials.
</p>

<h2>What are Acoustic Metamaterials?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Materials designed to control the transmission of sound waves</li>
  <li>Composed of small, repeating structures that alter the path of sound waves</li>
  <li>Result in unusual acoustic properties</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Project</h2>

<p>
The goal of our project was to design and fabricate acoustic metamaterials that could be used to control the propagation of sound waves in certain frequency ranges. We used a combination of computer simulations and experimental techniques to analyze the acoustic behavior of different materials and structures.
</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Designing materials that could manipulate sound waves in very specific ways</li>
  <li>Considering factors such as the size and shape of the repeating structures, the distance between them, and the type of material used</li>
